Subject: [PATCH v2 1/1] usb-storage: Add unusual-devs entry for Novatek NTK96550-based camera

Add the US_FL_BULK_IGNORE_TAG quirk for Novatek NTK96550-based camera
to fix USB resets after sending SCSI vendor commands due to CBW and
CSW tags difference, leading to undesired slowness while communicating
with the device.

Please find below the copy of /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices with my
device plugged in (listed as TechSys USB mass storage here, the
underlying chipset being the Novatek NTK96550-based camera):
